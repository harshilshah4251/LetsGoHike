Technology Review: Shiny vs. Streamlit for Interactive Web Apps
1. Background & Problem Statement
The Trail Suggesting Tool for Hikers requires a Python-based interactive web application where users can:

Input preferences (location, difficulty, elevation gain).
View interactive maps and trail visualizations.
Filter and explore different hiking trails dynamically.
To implement this, we need a framework that allows fast and easy web app development while being:
 User-friendly – Minimal coding effort for UI development.
 Efficient – Handles real-time user interactions smoothly.
 Scalable – Capable of managing moderate user traffic.
 Well-integrated – Compatible with Python libraries like Pandas, Folium, and APIs.

Shiny for Python provides a highly reactive programming model, allowing for dynamic user interactions with 
fine-grained control over UI elements. This makes it well-suited for complex applications requiring real-time 
interactivity, but it comes with a steeper learning curve and requires more setup and configuration compared 
to other frameworks. It also has slightly higher computational overhead due to its reactivity model, making it 
less efficient for lightweight applications.

On the other hand, Streamlit is designed for simplicity and speed, allowing developers to create fully functional 
data apps with just a few lines of Python code. It seamlessly integrates with popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy,
 and Folium, making it ideal for our use case. While it lacks advanced UI customization compared to Shiny, its ease
 of deployment, lightweight nature, and one-click hosting via Streamlit Cloud make it the better choice for quickly
 building and deploying the Trail Suggesting Tool.

Final Choice: Streamlit
After evaluating both frameworks, we decided to use Streamlit for the Trail Suggesting Tool because:

Simplicity – Requires less code compared to Shiny.
Quick Prototyping – Ideal for fast MVP development with minimal boilerplate.
Seamless Integration – Works well with Folium for maps, Pandas for data, and APIs.
Deployment Ease – Can be hosted easily on Streamlit Cloud without additional configurations.
